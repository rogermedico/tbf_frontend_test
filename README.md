This is a responsive webpage that is a reproduction from the video of the tests.

## How to use it

1. Clone the repository
2. Execute npm install to get all the dependencies
3. Execute `npm run watch` or `npm run hot`. Laravel mix will build the assets and start watching your source files and rebuilding the assets when they change.
4. You can also run `npm run prod` and open index.html under public folder.
